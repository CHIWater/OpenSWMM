## OpenSWMM 5.1.912

Released June 16, 2017.

This is the source code for [OpenSWMM version 5.1.912](https://www.openswmm.org/SWMM51912), a public domain computational engine based on [EPA SWMM5 version 5.1.012](https://www.openswmm.org/SWMM51012). It should produce identical results to EPA SWMM5.1.012, provided none of the unique features of this engine are used (see Disclaimer below).

The purpose of the OpenSWMM engine is to:

- provide a method for adding community-generated improvements to the SWMM feature set,
- provide quality control and testing for community-generated SWMM code,
- provide an easier method for the US EPA to incorporate community-requested features into the official version of EPA SWMM, should they so choose, and
- provide a transparent, commentable source code repository to facilitate community education and engagement.

The source code for this engine is provided here and in a more user-friendly form on [OpenSWMM.org](https://www.openswmm.org/SWMM51912) - it is up to the user to satisfy him/herself that the code changes are correct for their needs and the output is useful.
